# Blind Search in Large-Scale Problem Spaces

This project implements blind search algorithms (BFS, DFS, Depth-Limited Search, Iterative Deepening)
and compares them against informed search methods (A* and Greedy Search).  
Three problem domains are tested:
- Maze navigation
- 8-Puzzle
- N-Queens

## Algorithms Implemented
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)
- Greedy Best-First Search
- A* Search

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- matplotlib
- numpy
- tracemalloc (built-in)
